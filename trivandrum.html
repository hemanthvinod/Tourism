          <p class="text-light py-3">
            Thiruvananthapuram is the capital city of Kerala. Thiruvananthapuram
            was known as Trivandrum till 1991. The Kerala government in 1991
            officially reinstated its original name - Thiruvananthapuram.
            Located at the southwestern tip of India, Thiruvananthapuram
            district is bounded by the Arabian Sea on the west and Tamil Nadu on
            the east. With its 78 km coastline, internationally renowned
            beaches, historic monuments, backwater stretches and a rich cultural
            heritage, Thiruvananthapuram district is a much sought after tourist
            destination in Kerala.
            <br />
            "Abode of Lord Ananta" is what Thiruvananthapuram means in Sanskrit.
            Ananta is the cosmic serpent, with a thousand heads, on whom the
            Hindu God Vishnu reclines. The Sri Padmanabhaswami Temple devoted to
            lord Vishnu or Padmanabha is an iconic landmark of
            Thiruvananthapuram city.
